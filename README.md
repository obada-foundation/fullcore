# fullcore: Ledger code for obada network

## ℹ️ Overview

`fullcore` is the ledger/node component of the OBADA network tech stack, built using [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) and [Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint).

### 🚧 Testnet

Our [testnet](http://explorer.alpha.obada.io/) is the easiest place for developers and node operators to get started.

### 📌 Currently supported functionality

* Basic token functionality for holding and transferring tokens to other accounts on the same network
* Creating, managing, and configuring accounts and keys on a OBADA node
* Minting and transferning OBADA NFTs

## 🛠 Developing & contributing to OBADA

`fullcore` is written in Go and built using Cosmos SDK. The [Cosmos SDK Developer Guide](https://docs.cosmos.network/) explains a lot of the [basic concepts](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/basics/app-anatomy.html) of how the OBADA network functions.

### Creating a local network

If you are building from source, or otherwise interested in running a local network, we have [instructions on how to set up a new network](https://github.com/obada-foundation/local-network-playground) for development purposes.
