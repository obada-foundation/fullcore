## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe that you have identified a security vulnerability in any of OBADA's projects, we encourage you to share your findings with us.

At OBADA, we treat all security bugs with the utmost importance. If your discovery is confirmed after a thorough investigation, we will take prompt action to fix it and issue a public security bulletin that acknowledges the impact of the issue and credits you as the discoverer.

You can contact us about any security concerns at techops@obada.io.
